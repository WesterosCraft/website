    <h1>WesterosCraft Wiki</h1>
    <p>
      WesterosCraft is a fan-made project dedicated to recreating the fictional
      world of Westeros from George R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" book
      series, popularly known for its television adaptation "Game of Thrones."
      WesterosCraft is essentially a massive Minecraft server that aims to
      recreate the entire continent of Westeros in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project started in 2011 and has since grown into an ambitious
      undertaking involving hundreds of dedicated builders and contributors.
      They meticulously recreate various locations, cities, castles, and
      landmarks from the books, striving for accuracy and attention to detail.
      The WesterosCraft team uses custom texture packs, mods, and tools to
      replicate the distinct architecture, geography, and atmosphere of
      Westeros.
