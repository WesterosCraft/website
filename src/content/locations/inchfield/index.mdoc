### Construction

Antalex begins to build Inchfield in November 2014. The build continued until September 2015, when it was completed. The largest part of the build were several sub-projects, hamlets and agricultural buildings.

### Inspiration

The inspiration for Inchfield was Normandie (France), especially the design and layout of the fields and pastures.
