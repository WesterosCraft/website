**King's Landing** is the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, and its second largest city after [Oldtown](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/reach/oldtown). The city was founded on the site where Aegon I (Aegon the Conqueror) landed on the mainland of Westeros from the Targaryen fortress on [Dragonstone](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/crownlands/dragonstone). What was once only hills and forest became the center of politics, religion, and trade on the continent in its three-hundred year history. The population of King's Landing is estimated around a half million, but swells during times of war when it is flooded with refugees.

Geographically, the city is located where the Blackwater Rush empties into Blackwater Bay in the [Crownlands](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/crownlands), north of the Kingswood. Several major roads connect the capital to the rest of the Seven Kingdoms. The Kingsroad stretches north through the [Riverlands](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/riverlands), past the [Vale](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/vale) and all the way to [Winterfell](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/north/winterfell) and [The Wall](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/the-wall) in the [North](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/north), it also continues south to [Storm's End](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/stormlands/storms-end) in the [Stormlands](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/stormlands). The Rose Road branches southwest through the [Reach](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/reach) towards [Tumbleton](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/reach/tumbleton), [Highgarden](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/reach/highgarden), and [Oldtown](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/reach/oldtown); while the Gold Road crosses the Blackwater Rush towards [Casterly Rock](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/westerlands/casterly-rock) and [Lannisport](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/westerlands/lannisport) in the [Westerlands](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/westerlands). The port of King's Landing is busy with ships from all major cities in both Westeros and Essos. Historically, the trade in the ports of nearby [Duskendale](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/crownlands/duskendale) and [Maidenpool](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/riverlands/maidenpool) was diminished as King's Landing grew into a major center of trade.

The city is built on three hills named after Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys. Aegon's High Hill is the tallest and was the site of the Aegon Fort, a earth-and-timber fort first constructed when Aegon's forces landed. This rudimentary fort was expanded over the years until Maegor I "Maegor the Cruel" constructed Maegor's Holdfast, the beginning of what would grow in the Red Keep, the Targaryen palace that rises above the city and overlooks the bay from its prominent cliff and includes the Iron Throne. Rhaenys' Hill rises to the north where the Targaryen's built the Dragonpit, a massive dome that once housed the royal dragons until it fell into ruins. Before the Dragonpit, the Sept of Remembrance was located on this hill, which honored Queen Rhaenys' memory. Visenya's Hill rises to the west and is crowned by the Great Sept of Baelor, which sept replaced an earlier sept built by Aegon and the First High Septon. King Baelor I moved the center of the Faith from Oldtown's Starry Sept to King's Landing.

FIGURE HERE EVENTUALLY

In its early years, Kings Landing was a "city without walls" because it was protected by the Targaryen dragons, but Aegon ordered that walls be constructed in 19 AC and they were completed by 26 AC. The walls are manned by the City Watch of King's Landing and include seven gate houses and although they were built to leave room for the city's future growth, the city has since overflowed into the surrounding lands. The city is connected by several broad streets, such as the Street of the Sisters from the Dragonpit to the Great Sept of Baelor, the River Row along the Blackwater, the Muddyway, the Street of Steel on Visenya's Hill, among others. In the center of the city is the Dragonsquare, which is surrounded by important guilds, a market hall, and a bath house. Other notable squares are Cobbler's Square and the market squares at each of the seven gates. In addition to the Great Sept of Baelor, there are seven smaller septs, each devoted to one aspect of the seven.

The city has greatly disparate neighborhoods, from wealthy merchants and influential politicians in their manses near the Red Keep or the Sept of Baelor to the slums of Fleabottom on the south side of Rhaenys' Hill. The streets are often cobbled in wealthier districts of the city, but in poorer areas, the winding back alleys are a mixture of mud and sewage. Several small streams that once ran between the three hills of King's Landing have been turned into a labyrinth of sewers. The city is notorious for its stench, despite efforts by many kings and queens to improve the living conditions in the bustling capital.

## Features

Inside King's Landing:

- [**The Red Keep**](https://westeroscraft.com/locations/crownlands/red-keep), (/warp redkeep, /warp ironthrone, /warp maegors) a huge crimson castle sitting on the cliff Aegon's High Hill. The castle complex includes the Great Hall and the Iron Throne, Maegor's Holdfast, the royal apartments, the Tower of the Hand, the Maiden's Vault, the White Sword Tower and a godswood. There are several secret passages throughout the keep, which were built by Maegor the Cruel, who finished the construction of the Red Keep.
- **The Dragonpit**, (/warp dragonpit) is a collapsed dome where the Targaryens once kept their dragons. However, after the last dragon died, the gates were sealed and the pit fell into ruins. At present it is used to store wildfire. Whores know a way into the ruin and sometimes take customers there.
- **Septs and Religion**, (/warp greatseptofbaelor, /warp baelor) "Baelor the Blessed" brought the Fatih of the Seven to King's Landing and constructed the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya's Hill, replacing an older sept built by Aegon. In front of the sept complex of Baelor. Under the sept are the tombs of the Targaryen kings and queens, (/warp baelorscrypts) as well as dungeons. The Silent Sisters and other holy orders have facilities nearby. Throughout the city are seven septs, one dedicated to each aspect of the The Seven. Although there are no temples to any other deities in King's Landing, the diverse population likely practices other faiths from Essos, including a notable enclave of followers of R'hllor in the northern part of the city (/warp klredtemple).
- **Walls, Gates, and Defenses**, Aegon ordered the construction of the walls in 19 AC and they were completed seven years later in 26 AC. The plan included seven gates (listed below). The walls were built to allow for the city to grow, but the city has since expanded beyond the walls. In addition to the walls, the city has several towers used to spot fires and police the city, two main barracks, the West City Barracks near Cobbler's Square and the East City Barracks near the Dragon Gate. Near the mouth of the Blackwater are wynch towers that will lift a large chain to block off entry or exit from the harbor, one of the defense improvements made by Tyrion and Varys.

The two largest squares are Cobbler's Square (/warp cobblerssquare) in the northwest of the city, and Dragon Square (/warp dragonsquare) in the center. Fishmonger Square (/warp fishmongerssquare) is along the Blackwater inside the River Gate, and the other gates have major squares just inside the walls. Common features surrounding these squares include customs houses, merchant stalls, pubs, inns, brothels, mummer shows and executioner blocks or gallows because they are conspicuous gathering places for the residents of the city. Beneath many of these squares are important intersections of the city's sewer system, which was built when the streets were laid out after Aegon's walls were planned.

  - **Other Streets** include **Eel Alley**, located on Visenya's Hill. An inn may be found here; **Pigrun Alley**, enclosed by tall timber-and-stone buildings whose upper stories lean out so far over the streets that they nearly touch those of the buildings across from them; **Reeking Lane**, a street full of apprentices; **Sowbelly Row**, the street Lollys Stokeworth was found wandering along after she had been raped half a hundred times behind a tanner's shop during the Riot of King's Landing; **Pisswater Bend**, a street which is probably located in the Flea Bottom area.

## Construction

The construction process began in the southern part of city, moved roughly counterclockwise. The city was divided in many diferent sections, where builders were able to work on houses that were later approved by moderators. There were also several mini-builds, places special, relevant or big enough to have an application needed before construction was approved.

The Dragonpit, Baelor's Sept and the Red Keep all had their separeted building process, to have the proper attention these huge and important locations need. Also, the sewer/underground building process happened in parallel of the rest of the city.

The city counts with an incredible number of 5201 unique houses, with 877 of those being located in the sprawl area. The top 5 builders by number of houses built are as following:

- CaptScribble - 772 houses
- Leftie - 294 houses
- pottman - 290 houses
- Nemeko - 241 houses
- Rickard_Karstark - 238 houses

The city has an average of aproximate 4.5 beds per house, with more than 20 thousand beds in total.

## Old King's Landing

FIGURE HERE EVENTUALLY

A version of King's Landing was completed in 2012 as a server project led by Dutchguard, Marken4, Contra, NickShaiB, Whitefireneo, FlemishGuard, IwandeLarch, Feasting, and Sn0wst0rm. This version included all of the prominent structures, led by two moderators working together. The build was scheduled to last for two months, but took closer to half a year to complete. All of the houses were built and furnished by hand and the rough estimate is around 4,000 structures. The Red Keep was completed after five detailed tests. Although the city has been rebuilt with better textures and planning, many guests still enjoy visiting the old city, which was a massive achievement for the server at the time of completion. Interesting features include the Targaryen statues, the sewers, the graves on Visenya's hill, the tourney grounds, the Dragonpit, and of course the Red Keep complex and our original Iron Throne. Many locations can still be warped to (just add the word "old" to warp names) and the moderators plan on keeping the city on the server for posterity. Example of warps include: /warp kingslandingold, /warp redkeepold, /warp ironthroneold, /warp dragonpitold, /warp dragonsquareold, among others.
