There are several canon extinct houses of Dorne, the ruins of which might be built together as a Megabuild, or split off separately as full projects or Mini Builds.

These houses were among the dozen First Men houses of the Greenblood who chose a High King of Dorne from among their number. Three of the houses (unspecified) were destroyed after a generation of warfare following a disputed election. The remaining houses were conquered during the Andal invasion.

They are:
