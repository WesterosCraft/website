**Sunspear** is the capital of [Dorne](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/dorne) and the seat of **House Martell**, the Great House of Dorne. It is a dense, coastal town and the buildings are cramped and they "clung to the castle like barnacles to a galleyâ€™s hull."

The three main structures of the castle are the Spear Tower, the Tower of the Sun, and the Sandship.

There is an old version of Sunspear at _/warp sunspearold_
