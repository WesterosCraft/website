      There’s a map of it in each book, but the scale is just mind-boggling.
      It’s 650 miles just from Castle Black to Winterfell, let alone all the way
      to King’s Landing (2110 miles). And they don’t even have cars!

      It's hard to watch videos from Westeroscraft—the stunningly ambitious
      project to re-create the entire world of Game of Thrones in Minecraft—and
      not be impressed.

      WesterosCraft is, undeniably, a tremendous accomplishment, but not simply
      as a vast, intricate model or simulacrum of someone else’s world. Rather,
      it is an immense act of creativity in its own right, a story built upon a
      story that the WesterosCraft community is telling together, block by
      block.
