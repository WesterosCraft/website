    WesterosCraft is a modded server where visitors can explore the entire
    continent of Westeros and are free to join the community of builders
    bringing it to life. Wander the streets of Kingâ€™s Landing or the fields of
    Highgarden. Take a flight through the deadly Moon Door, or even retrace the
    steps of your favorite character.

        As Minecraft updates and evolves, so too does our server! From simple
        cobblestone shacks in 2011, to ornate cities in 2022, we have come a
        long way from our humble beginnings.
